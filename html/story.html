                <h3> The story</h3>
                <p>
                      &ensp;  The folktale begins with a princess whose parents are told by a wicked fairy that their daughter will die when she pricks her finger on a particular item.&nbsp;
                        In Basile's version, the princess pricks her finger on a piece of flax. In Perrault's and the Grimm Brothers' versions, the item is a spindle.&nbsp;
                        The parents rid the kingdom of these items in the hopes of protecting their daughter, but the prophecy is fulfilled regardless. Instead of dying, as was foretold, the princess falls into a deep sleep.&nbsp;
                        After some time, she is found by a prince and is awakened. In Giambattista Basile's version of Sleeping Beauty, Sun, Moon, and Talia, the sleeping beauty, Talia, falls into a deep sleep after getting a splinter of flax in her finger.&nbsp;
                        She is discovered in her castle by a wandering king, who "carrie[s] her to a bed, where he gather[s] the first fruits of love."[18] He abandons her there after the assault and she later gives birth to twins while still unconscious.&nbsp;
